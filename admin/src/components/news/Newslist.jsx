                WNBA Finals 2022: Alyssa Thomas' historic Game 3 triple double helps Connecticut stave off elimination

                The first-ever triple double in the WNBA Finals by Thomas paces the Sun to a 105-76 victory over the Las Vegas Aces, forcing a Game 4 on Sunday.

                <p>Alyssa Thomas had a landmark triple double and Jonquel Jones scored a team-high 20 points as the Connecticut Sun stayed alive in the 2022 WNBA Finals with a 105-76 Game 3 win against the Las Vegas Aces on Thursday (15 September).
                <br /><br />
                Thomas' 16 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists - the first triple double in WNBA Finals history - helped the Sun trim the Aces' series lead to 2-1.
                <br /><br />
                Connecticut had six players score in double figures. Their 105 points were the most-ever in a playoff game in franchise history.
                <br /><br />
                "She's probably the toughest player I ever coached", Sun head coach Curt Miller said of Thomas, who also chipped in two steals and a block on the evening.
                <br /><br />
                "But she's the most consistent player in terms of effort that I've ever been around. I know what I'm going to get every single day she plays and that's what makes her special".
                <br /><br />
                Las Vegas were led by Jackie Young's 22 points and 19 points from league MVP A'ja Wilson.
                <br /><br />
                Game 4 is on Sunday in Connecticut.
                <br /><br />
                In a win-or-go-home situation, the Sun got off to a blazing start, outscoring the Aces 34-19 in the first quarter.
                <br /><br />
                The visitors tried to keep up, moving within eight points after the third but Connecticut pulled away in the final quarter and never looked back.</p>
